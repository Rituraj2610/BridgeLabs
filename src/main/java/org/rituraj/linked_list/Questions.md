# Linked List-Based Systems

This repository contains implementations of various systems using different types of linked lists. Each system demonstrates how to perform various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying data in singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.

### 1. **Singly Linked List: Student Record Management**

#### Problem Statement:
Create a program to manage student records using a singly linked list. Each node will store information about a student, including:
- Roll Number
- Name
- Age
- Grade

#### Operations:
- Add a new student record at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Delete a student record by Roll Number.
- Search for a student record by Roll Number.
- Display all student records.
- Update a student's grade based on their Roll Number.

### 2. **Doubly Linked List: Movie Management System**

#### Problem Statement:
Implement a movie management system using a doubly linked list. Each node will represent a movie and contain:
- Movie Title
- Director
- Year of Release
- Rating

#### Operations:
- Add a movie record at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Remove a movie record by Movie Title.
- Search for a movie record by Director or Rating.
- Display all movie records in both forward and reverse order.
- Update a movie's Rating based on the Movie Title.

### 3. **Circular Linked List: Task Scheduler**

#### Problem Statement:
Create a task scheduler using a circular linked list. Each node in the list represents a task with:
- Task ID
- Task Name
- Priority
- Due Date

#### Operations:
- Add a task at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the circular list.
- Remove a task by Task ID.
- View the current task and move to the next task in the circular list.
- Display all tasks in the list starting from the head node.
- Search for a task by Priority.

### 4. **Singly Linked List: Inventory Management System**

#### Problem Statement:
Design an inventory management system using a singly linked list where each node stores information about an item:
- Item Name
- Item ID
- Quantity
- Price

#### Operations:
- Add an item at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Remove an item based on Item ID.
- Update the quantity of an item by Item ID.
- Search for an item based on Item ID or Item Name.
- Calculate and display the total value of inventory (Sum of Price * Quantity for each item).
- Sort the inventory based on Item Name or Price in ascending or descending order.

### 5. **Doubly Linked List: Library Management System**

#### Problem Statement:
Design a library management system using a doubly linked list. Each node represents a book and contains the following attributes:
- Book Title
- Author
- Genre
- Book ID
- Availability Status

#### Operations:
- Add a new book at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Remove a book by Book ID.
- Search for a book by Book Title or Author.
- Update a bookâ€™s Availability Status.
- Display all books in forward and reverse order.
- Count the total number of books in the library.

### 6. **Circular Linked List: Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm**

#### Problem Statement:
Implement a round-robin CPU scheduling algorithm using a circular linked list. Each node will represent a process with:
- Process ID
- Burst Time
- Priority

#### Operations:
- Add a new process at the end of the circular list.
- Remove a process by Process ID after its execution.
- Simulate the scheduling of processes in a round-robin manner with a fixed time quantum.
- Display the list of processes in the circular queue after each round.
- Calculate and display the average waiting time and turn-around time for all processes.

### 7. **Singly Linked List: Social Media Friend Connections**

#### Problem Statement:
Create a system to manage social media friend connections using a singly linked list. Each node represents a user with:
- User ID
- Name
- Age
- List of Friend IDs

#### Operations:
- Add a friend connection between two users.
- Remove a friend connection.
- Find mutual friends between two users.
- Display all friends of a specific user.
- Search for a user by Name or User ID.
- Count the number of friends for each user.

### 8. **Doubly Linked List: Undo/Redo Functionality for Text Editor**

#### Problem Statement:
Design an undo/redo functionality for a text editor using a doubly linked list. Each node represents a state of the text content (e.g., after typing a word or performing a command).

#### Operations:
- Add a new text state at the end of the list every time the user types or performs an action.
- Implement the undo functionality (revert to the previous state).
- Implement the redo functionality (revert back to the next state after undo).
- Display the current state of the text.
- Limit the undo/redo history to a fixed size (e.g., last 10 states).

### 9. **Circular Linked List: Online Ticket Reservation System**

#### Problem Statement:
Design an online ticket reservation system using a circular linked list, where each node represents a booked ticket. Each node will store the following information:
- Ticket ID
- Customer Name
- Movie Name
- Seat Number
- Booking Time

#### Operations:
- Add a new ticket reservation at the end of the circular list.
- Remove a ticket by Ticket ID.
- Display the current tickets in the list.
- Search for a ticket by Customer Name or Movie Name.
- Calculate the total number of booked tickets.
